# Status ledger

Every row points at a checkable artifact. Statuses: **proved in Lean**
(builds, no `sorry`), **anchored** (build-verified restatement of a pinned
Mathlib theorem), **stated** (precise `Prop`, deliberately unproved),
**computed** (executed notebook with committed outputs), **notes only**,
**explicitly not claimed**.

| Claim | Status | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Finite initial segments, divisibility order, and zeta/incidence predicates | proved in Lean | `RiemannVenue/Divisibility/Poset.lean`, `RiemannVenue/Divisibility/Incidence.lean` |
| Finite Möbius inversion on the divisibility poset `{1, …, N}` | proved in Lean | `RiemannVenue/Divisibility/Mobius.lean` (`mobius_inversion_initialSegment`) |

| `K(m,n) = gcd(m,n)/√(mn)` is positive semidefinite at every level `N` | proved in Lean | `RiemannVenue/Kernels/Positivity.lean` (`normalizedGcdKernel_posSemidef`); re-exported as `RiemannVenue/Venue/NoLeak.lean` (`noLeak_finite`) |

| Finite-polydisc Bochner identity: the product Poisson measure's Fourier coefficients are `∏ a_p^{\|k_p\|}`, and at `a_p = p^{-1/2}`, `k_p = v_p(m)−v_p(n)` this equals `gcd(m,n)/√(mn)` — the spectral face of the kernel at finite prime sets | proved in Lean | `RiemannVenue/Kernels/Polydisc.lean` (`integral_polydisc_poissonKernel_mul_exp`, `prod_rpow_half_factorization_eq_gcd_div_sqrt`) |
| `−log‖1−p^{-σ}e^{iθ}‖` has the prime-power cosine expansion; its radial derivative at `σ = 1/2` is `−`(prime-power side vs. `cos`) | proved in Lean | `RiemannVenue/Weil/LogDerivative.lean` (`hasSum_neg_log_norm_one_sub`, `hasDerivAt_sum_primePower_terms`) |

| The direct length-side limit fails: `κ((n+2)/(n+1))` not summable; `∑_p 1/p` diverges (the "False as stated" row, itself machine-checked) | proved in Lean | `RiemannVenue/Venue/NonRadon.lean` (`not_summable_kappa_consecutive`, `not_summable_one_div_primes`) |
| `λ_min(K_N)` decay rate to `N = 1.3×10⁷` via the exact Möbius-sparse inverse: `c/(log N)²` rejected, `A·exp(−c√log N)` (`c ≈ 1.36`) survives; minimizer Liouville-signed on smooth numbers; `λ_min·λ_max ≈ 0.389` over five decades | investigated (numerics + literature; apparently open) | `notes/lambda-min-rate.md`, `notebooks/lambda-min-rate.ipynb`, `scripts/lambda_min_lanczos.py`, `figures/lambda-min-rate.png`, `figures/lambda-min-lanczos.png` |
